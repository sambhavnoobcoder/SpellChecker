## Spell Checker

### Intro

this is a repository initilaised in order to track the changes and the perofrmance of differntn algotrihms and their approaches , aimed to be optimised to the edge for minimum response time / latency.
the metric for the measurement of performance is response time per 1000 words . 

### Performance

so far the best performing approach gives the **response time per 1000 words** as **17.02 ms**  which translates to **0.01702 s**. 

### Screenshots

here is a screenshot of the said approach and its performnce :

in order to replicate the performance , the user is required to run the optimised-multithreading.py file in their respective coding environment.
